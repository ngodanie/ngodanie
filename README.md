<h1>About Me</h1>
👋 Software Developer with +5 years of experience, with my first developer role in 2017.
<br><br>
I am goal-driven, a self-starter, pianist🎹, competitive badminton player🏸, competitive gamer🎮, consistent weight-lifter🏋️‍♂️, fitness coach, and generally always aim to be the best that I can be. Hobby or not, I always strive to reach a high level of performance.
<br><br>
👔 <b>Work:</b> Senior Software Developer at Scotiabank, one of the "Big 5" banks in Canada. My role consists primarily of custom solution architecture/development and modernization of payment platforms.
<br><br>
👨‍💻 <b>Skills:</b> My primary languages include <b>Visual Basic</b>, <b>C#</b>, <b>JavaScript</b>, and <b>HTML</b>. I also have experience in end-to-end project implementations and management. Some short-term goals include learning Node, React, and Angular.
<br><br>
💆‍♂️ <b>Past:</b> I have some past experience with <b>Python</b> and <b>Java</b> as well, although it's been a while since I've last touched them. I'm confident I can relearn them should the occasion arise.
